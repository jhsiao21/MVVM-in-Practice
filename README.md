## MVVM in Practice


### About

This example originates from [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/sWx8TtRBOfk?si=LT1cGz0qrGVFRXdq) lab exercise, initially designed for the older Xcode 10.1 version. I've made some modifications to the code and updated it for Xcode 15.0.1, supporting Swift 5. 

This lab focuses on writing programs with an MVVM architecture and utilizing delegate for data binding functionality. The author also mentions that this simple example can help understand the data binding mechanism, paving the way for further exploration into the RxSwift framework.

### What I learned?
- A simple data binding mechanism with delegation.
- A few Q&A questions about techniques, such as, 'Why is the author using a class instead of a struct for the user view model?'"
